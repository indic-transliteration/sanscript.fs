# sanscript.fs
This is the F# port of [sanscript.js](https://github.com/indic-transliteration/sanscript.js).

# Development flow
The development will follow the [Git flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) until we have the "first good release" (a.k.a feature-parity with sanscript.js) and then will switch to a much easier [github flow](https://githubflow.github.io/).

This means, until the first release, all development will go on the `develop` branch, with almost nothing (except the initial commit that has this README, LICENSE and the starting parse-code for json schemes) in the `main` branch. These formed a part of the initial commit to the project, and therefore continue to be there even before the "first good release".
